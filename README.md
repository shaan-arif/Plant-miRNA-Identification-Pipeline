# Plant-miRNA-Identification-Pipeline
This repository contains a complete pipeline for small RNA-seq data processing and miRNA discovery (both known and novel). The workflow is optimized for reads 18â€“34 nt long and includes trimming, filtering, alignment, and prediction steps.

### What is Small RNA Sequencing (sRNA-Seq)?
Small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) is a high-throughput method used to profile small regulatory RNA molecules, typically ranging from 18 to 34 nucleotides. These include:

- microRNAs (miRNAs)

- small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)

- piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)

- tRNA fragments (tRFs)

- other non-coding small RNAs

These small RNAs play crucial roles in gene regulation, development, stress responses, and epigenetic regulation, especially in plants. Unlike mRNA-seq, small RNA-seq data requires specialized preprocessing steps.
